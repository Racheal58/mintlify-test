# Documentation Architecture Overview

## Decision-Making Process

We redesigned the documentation structure to support:

1. Product versioning
2. Multi-language support
3. Scalable long-term growth
4. Clear upgrade paths between versions

The previous structure only supported a single version (V1) in English. As the product matures, this will become limiting for both users and maintainers.

We introduced:

- Semantic versioning (`1.0.0`, `2.0.0`)
- Language segmentation (`en`, `fr`)
- Dedicated changelog and API reference sections

This approach aligns the documentation with real product lifecycle practices.

## Key User Experience Improvements

### 1. Version Clarity
Users can now:
- Stay on a stable version
- Upgrade intentionally
- Reference historical documentation

This reduces confusion during migrations.

---

### 2. Language Accessibility
French documentation enables:
- Broader adoption
- Regional compliance support
- Better onboarding for non-English users

---

### 3. Developer-Centric Enhancements
- Dedicated API Reference improves integration workflows
- Changelog page improves transparency
- Advanced Usage section keeps core docs clean while supporting power users

---

### 4. Logical Content Separation
Each version is fully self-contained.
Users do not mix content from different releases.

---

## Trade-Offs Considered

### Increased Structural Complexity
The new structure is more nested and harder to maintain manually.
However, this complexity is necessary for scalability.

### Content Duplication Across Languages
French pages currently mirror English pages.
This requires translation maintenance overhead.

## How This Structure Scales

This architecture supports:

- Adding new versions (`3.0.0`, `4.0.0`)
- Adding new languages (`es`, `de`, `pt`)
- Adding beta or experimental channels
- Deprecating older versions without removing them
