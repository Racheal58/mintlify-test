# Inventory Management - v2.0

<Info>
  Track salsa ingredients with AI-powered predictions and real-time IoT sensor
  monitoring.
</Info>

## Overview

Our v2.0 inventory management system uses artificial intelligence and IoT sensors to provide intelligent tracking, predictive ordering, and automated waste prevention.

## Key Features

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="AI-Powered Tracking">
      Monitor your ingredient levels with intelligent predictions:

      - **Predictive stock levels**: AI forecasts when you'll run out
      - **Automated reordering**: Smart ordering based on usage patterns
      - **Usage predictions**: Machine learning predicts ingredient needs
      - **Anomaly detection**: AI identifies unusual consumption patterns

      ```javascript sample.js
         // Example: Get AI inventory predictions
         const predictions = await salsa.ai.inventory.predict({
         location: "kitchen_1",
         horizon_days: 7
         });

         console.log(`Predicted reorder date: ${predictions.reorder_date}`);
      ```

   </Tab>
   <Tab title="IoT Sensor Integration">
      Real-time monitoring with connected sensors:

      - **RFID tracking**: Automatic ingredient scanning
      - **Temperature sensors**: Monitor refrigeration conditions
      - **Weight sensors**: Real-time stock level tracking
      - **Freshness sensors**: Chemical sensors detect spoilage

   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Smart Waste Prevention">
      AI-driven waste reduction:

      - Predicts optimal order quantities
      - Suggests recipes to use near-expiry ingredients
      - Identifies waste patterns and root causes
      - Reduces waste by up to 60% compared to v1.0

   </Tab>
