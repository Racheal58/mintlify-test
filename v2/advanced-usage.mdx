## AI-Powered Demand Forecasting

### Understanding the Forecasting Engine

v2.0's AI forecasting engine uses multiple machine learning models to predict salsa demand with industry-leading accuracy:

### Configuring Advanced Forecasting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Forecast Horizon">
    Choose your forecasting window based on your operational needs:
    - **Short-term (7 days)**: Daily production planning
    - **Medium-term (14 days)**: Ingredient ordering and staffing
    - **Long-term (30+ days)**: Strategic planning and seasonal prep
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Data Sources">
    Connect additional data sources to improve accuracy:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript sample.js
    const forecastConfig = {
      data_sources: {
        pos_sales: true,
        reservations: true,
        weather_api: "openweathermap",
        events: ["eventbrite", "local_calendar"],
        foot_traffic: "sensor_data",
        social_media: ["yelp", "google_reviews"]
      },
      model_parameters: {
        confidence_level: 0.95,
        seasonality: "auto_detect",
        trend_sensitivity: "medium",
        anomaly_detection: true
      }
    };
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Alert Thresholds">
    Configure alerts for significant forecast changes or anomalies.
  </Step>

   <Step title="Enable Auto-Actions">
    Let AI automatically adjust production schedules based on forecasts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## IoT Sensor Integration

### Sensor Types and Capabilities

### Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

Access comprehensive sensor data in real-time:

<Info>
**Dashboard Features**: Live sensor feeds, historical trends, anomaly alerts, predictive maintenance warnings, and automated reports.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```python sample.py
# Example: Query sensor data via API
from salsa_sdk import SalsaClient

client = SalsaClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Get real-time sensor readings
sensors = client.iot.get_sensors(location="kitchen_1")
for sensor in sensors:
    reading = sensor.get_latest_reading()
    print(f"{sensor.name}: {reading.value} {reading.unit}")

    if reading.is_anomaly():
        print(f"⚠️  Alert: {reading.anomaly_details}")

# Query historical data
history = client.iot.query_history(
    sensor_id="temp_sensor_001",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31",
    aggregation="hourly"
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Predictive Maintenance

AI analyzes sensor patterns to predict equipment failures before they occur:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Equipment Profiling">
    System learns normal operating parameters for each piece of equipment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Anomaly Detection">
    ML models detect subtle changes that indicate potential issues:
    - Temperature fluctuations
    - Unusual vibration patterns
    - Performance degradation
    - Power consumption changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Failure Prediction">
    Predicts equipment failures 3-14 days in advance with 85% accuracy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated Alerts">
    Notifies maintenance team with specific recommended actions.

### Compliance & Audit

### API & Integration Platform

Build custom solutions with our enterprise API:

#### GraphQL API

Modern, flexible API with real-time subscriptions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql sample.graphql
    query GetProductionForecast {
      forecast(location: "loc_123", days: 7) {
        date
        recipes {
          id
          name
          predictedDemand {
            quantity
            unit
            confidence
          }
        }
      }
    }

    subscription OnQualityAlert {
      qualityAlert(location: "loc_123") {
        id
        severity
        sensorId
        message
        timestamp
      }
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### REST API

Traditional REST endpoints for compatibility:

    ```bash
    # Get forecast
    curl -X GET https://api.salsaasaservice.com/v2/forecast \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"

    # Create production batch
    curl -X POST https://api.salsaasaservice.com/v2/production/batches \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"recipe_id": "rec_456", "quantity": 5.0}'
    ```

#### Webhooks v2

Enhanced webhook system with:

    - Guaranteed delivery with retry logic
    - Event filtering and routing
    - Payload transformation
    - Signature verification
    - Delivery status tracking

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript sample.js
    // Webhook payload example
    {
      "event": "quality.alert.created",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "data": {
        "alert_id": "alert_789",
        "location_id": "loc_123",
        "severity": "high",
        "message": "Temperature out of range",
        "sensor_id": "temp_001",
        "reading": {
          "value": 45.3,
          "threshold": 40.0
        }
      },
      "signature": "sha256=abc123..."
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

Optimize API queries for large-scale operations:

<CodeGroup>
```graphql sample.graphql
# Use field-level caching
query GetLocations @cache(ttl: 300) {
  locations {
    id
    name
    # Only request fields you need
    currentInventory {
      ingredientId
      quantity
    }
  }
}

# Use pagination for large datasets
query GetProductionHistory($first: Int = 50, $after: String) {
  productionBatches(first: $first, after: $after) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        recipeId
        quantity
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>


### Caching Strategies

Implement caching for optimal performance:

1. **CDN Caching**
   Static resources cached at edge locations for fast global access.

2. **API Response Caching**
   Frequently accessed data cached with configurable TTL.

3. **Client-Side Caching**
   Use our SDK's built-in caching for repeated queries.

4. **Cache Invalidation**
   Automatic cache invalidation on data updates.
