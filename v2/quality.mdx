# Quality Control - v2.0

<Info>
Ensure consistent salsa quality with AI-powered prediction and automated IoT testing.
</Info>

## Overview

v2.0 introduces AI quality prediction, automated IoT testing equipment, and computer vision for visual inspection. Catch quality issues before they happen.

## AI Quality Prediction

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Predictive Quality Scoring">
    AI predicts quality scores before batch completion:

    - Analyzes ingredient quality data
    - Monitors production conditions in real-time
    - Predicts final quality score with 95% accuracy
    - Provides early warnings for potential issues

    ```javascript
      // Example: Get AI quality prediction
      const prediction = await salsa.ai.quality.predict({
        batch_id: "BATCH-2024-001",
        current_stage: "mixing"
      });

      console.log(`Predicted quality: ${prediction.score}/10`);
      console.log(`Confidence: ${prediction.confidence}%`);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Anomaly Detection">
    AI identifies quality issues in real-time:

    - Unusual ingredient combinations
    - Temperature deviations during production
    - Inconsistent mixing times
    - pH level variations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## IoT Automated Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connected Testing Equipment">
    Automated quality tests with IoT devices:

    - **pH meters**: Continuous pH monitoring
    - **Viscosity sensors**: Consistency measurements
    - **Color sensors**: Visual consistency checks
    - **Temperature probes**: Production temperature tracking
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Computer Vision Inspection">
    AI-powered visual quality control:

    - Automated visual inspection using cameras
    - Defect detection (contamination, inconsistency)
    - Portion control verification
    - Packaging quality checks

    <Note>
      **New in v2.0**: Computer vision systems can inspect 100% of production, compared to manual sampling in v1.0.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quality Scoring

<Accordion title="AI-Enhanced Scoring">
  Machine learning improves quality assessment:

  ```javascript sample.js
    // Example: Record quality with AI assistance
    const qualityCheck = await salsa.ai.quality.recordScore({
      batch_id: "BATCH-2024-001",
      automated_scores: {
        visual_ai: 9.2,
        ph_sensor: 8.8,
        viscosity: 9.0,
        temperature: 10.0
      },
      manual_scores: {
        taste: 9.5
      },
      ai_analysis: true
    });
  ```
</Accordion>

    - Real-time violation alerts
    - Digital audit trails
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quality Insights

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI-Powered Analytics">
    Deep quality insights:

    - Root cause analysis for quality issues
    - Correlation between ingredients and scores
    - Supplier quality impact analysis
    - Production condition optimization
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Continuous Improvement">
    AI suggests quality improvements:

    - Ingredient substitution recommendations
    - Process optimization suggestions
    - Equipment upgrade recommendations
    - Training needs identification

    <Warning>
      **Critical Quality Alerts**: AI-detected safety issues trigger immediate production halts and manager notifications.
